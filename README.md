> This code is under early development

# ðŸ¤” What is this?

This is a Python package to help with analysis of the potential impacts of
climate hazards and other perils on infrastructure networks.


## Development

Clone this repository using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or on
the command line:

    git clone git@github.com:nismod/snail.git

Change directory into the root of the project:

    cd snail

To create and activate a conda environment with snail's dependencies installed:

    conda env create -f .environment.yml
    conda activate snail-dev

Run this to install the source code as a package:

    pip install .

If you're working on snail itself, install it as "editable" along with test and
development packages:

    pip install -e .[dev]

Run tests using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and
[pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io) to check coverage:

    pytest --cov=snail --cov-report=term-missing

Run a formatter ([black](https://github.com/psf/black)) to fix code
formatting:

    black src/snail

When working on the tutorial notebooks, it is recommended to install and
configure [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) so data and outputs
are not committed in the notebook files:

    nbstripout --install


### C++ library

The C++ library in `src/cpp` contains the core routines to find intersections of
lines with raster grids.

Before working on the C++ library, fetch source code for Catch2 unit testing
library (this is included as a git submodule):

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Build the library and run tests:

    cmake -Bbuild .
    cmake --build build/
    ./build/run_tests

Run code style auto-formatting:

    clang-format -i src/cpp/*.hpp

Run lints and checks:

    clang-tidy --checks 'cppcoreguidelines-*' src/cpp/*.hpp

This may need some includes for `pybind11` - which will vary depending on your
python installation. For example, with python via miniconda:

    clang-tidy --checks 'cppcoreguidelines-*' src/cpp/* -- \
        -I/home/username/miniconda3/include/python3.7m/ \
        -I./pybind11/include/


### Integration of C++ and Python using pybind11

The `snail.core.intersections` module is built using [`pybind11` with
`setuptools`](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/compiling.html#building-with-setuptools)

- `src/cpp/intersections.cpp` defines the module interface using the
  `PYBIND11_MODULE` macro
- `pyproject.toml` defines the build requirements for snail, which includes
  pybind11, wheel and setuptools
- `setup.py` defines the `Pybind11Extension` module to build - both the C++
  files to compile, and the location of the built module within the python
  package
