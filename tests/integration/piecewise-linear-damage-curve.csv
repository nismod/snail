# Example damage curve,
# - use # to add comment lines to a damage curve CSV
# - default column names are "intensity" and ""damage_ratio"
# - "damage_ratio" must be in the range [0, 1]
# - ""intensity"" must be in some hazard/peril units and should be
# documented in the header. E.g. "intensity is 10 minute mean surface
# wind speeds in m/s" or "intensity is flood depth in metres"
# - the header can also record source/citation details
