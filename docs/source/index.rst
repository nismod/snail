## Installation

Install using pip:

    pip install nismod-snail

This should bring all dependencies with it. If any of these cause difficulties,
try using a `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ environment::

    conda env create -n snail_env \
        python=3.8 geopandas shapely rasterio python-igraph
    conda activate snail_env
    pip install nismod-snail

If all worked okay, you should be able to run python and import snail::

    $ python
    >>> import snail
    >>> help(snail)

## Using the `snail` command

Once installed, you can use `snail` directly from the command line.

Split features on a grid defined by its transform, width and height::

   snail split \
      --features input.shp \
      --transform 1 0 -180 0 -1 90 \
      --width 360 \
      --height 180 \
      --output split.gpkg


Split features on a grid defined by a GeoTIFF, optionally adding the values from each raster band to each split feature as a new attribute::

   snail split \
      --features lines.geojson \
      --raster gridded_data.tif \
      --attribute \
      --output split_lines_with_raster_values.geojson


Split multiple vector feature files along the grids defined by multiple raster files, attributing all raster values::

   snail process -fs features.csv -rs rasters.csv

Where at a minimum, each CSV has a column `path` with the path to each file.
